Aim:Write a C++ Program to implement Object as Function arguments

program:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Number {
private:
    int num;

public:
    void getNumber() {
        cout << "Enter a number: ";
        cin >> num;
    }

    // Passing object as function argument
    void compare(Number n2) {
        if (num > n2.num)
            cout << num << " is greater than " << n2.num << endl;
        else if (num < n2.num)
            cout << n2.num << " is greater than " << num << endl;
        else
            cout << "Both numbers are equal" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Number n1, n2;

    cout << "Enter details for first object:\n";
    n1.getNumber();

    cout << "Enter details for second object:\n";
    n2.getNumber();

    // Passing object as argument
    n1.compare(n2);

    return 0;
}

output:
Enter details for first object:
Enter a number: 25
Enter details for second object:
Enter a number: 40
40 is greater than 25

Result:Thus C++ program was executed successfully.
