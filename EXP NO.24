Aim:Exception Handling

program:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a, b;
    cout << "Enter two numbers: ";
    cin >> a >> b;

    try {
        if(b == 0) {
            throw b; // Throwing an exception
        }
        cout << "Result: " << a / b << endl;
    }
    catch(int x) {
        cout << "Error: Division by zero is not allowed!" << endl;
    }

    cout << "Program continues..." << endl;
    return 0;
}

output:
Enter two numbers: 10 0
Error: Division by zero is not allowed!
Program continues...

Result:Thus C++ program was executed successfully.
