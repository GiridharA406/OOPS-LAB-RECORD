Aim:Write a C++ program to demonstrate the use of static data member and static member functions in a class.  

program:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
private:
    string name;
    int rollNo;
    static int count; // Static Data Member

public:
    void getData() {
        cout << "Enter Name: ";
        cin.ignore();
        getline(cin, name);
        cout << "Enter Roll Number: ";
        cin >> rollNo;
        count++; // Increasing static variable each time an object is created
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << ", Roll No: " << rollNo << endl;
    }

    // Static Member Function
    static void showCount() {
        cout << "Total number of students: " << count << endl;
    }
};

// Definition of static data member
int Student::count = 0;

int main() {
    Student s1, s2;

    cout << "Enter details of Student 1:\n";
    s1.getData();
    cout << "Enter details of Student 2:\n";
    s2.getData();

    cout << "\n--- Student Details ---\n";
    s1.display();
    s2.display();

    // Calling static member function
    Student::showCount();

    return 0;
}

output:
Enter details of Student 1:
Enter Name: Raj
Enter Roll Number: 10
Enter details of Student 2:
Enter Name: Sneha
Enter Roll Number: 18

--- Student Details ---
Name: Raj, Roll No: 10
Name: Sneha, Roll No: 18
Total number of students: 2

Result:Thus C++ program was executed successfully.
