Aim:.Write a C++ Program to demonstrate the Constructor and Destructor

program:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Demo {
public:
    // Constructor
    Demo() {
        cout << "Constructor is called!" << endl;
    }

    // Destructor
    ~Demo() {
        cout << "Destructor is called!" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    cout << "Creating object..." << endl;
    Demo obj;   // Object created → Constructor will be called

    cout << "Program is about to end..." << endl;
    return 0;  // When program ends, object goes out of scope → Destructor called
}

output:
Creating object...
Constructor is called!
Program is about to end...
Destructor is called!

Result:Thus C++ program was executed successfully.
